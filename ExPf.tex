\begin{exercise}[1.1.1]
    Let $Y$ be the plane curve $y={x}^{2}$. Show that $A(Y)$ is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in one variable over $K$. Let $Z$ be the plane curve $xy=1$. Show that $A(Z)$ is not isomorphic to a polynomial ring in one variable over $K$. Let $f$ be any irreducible quadratic polynomial in $K[x,y]$, and let $W$ be the
    conic defined by $f$ Show that $A(W)$ is isomorphic to $A(Y)$ or $A(Z)$. Which one
    is it when?
